🚀 CIFAR-10 Object Classification with CNN 🐸✈️🚗
A simple, modular Python project for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project focuses on cleanly separating data loading, preprocessing, model training, and prediction into reusable modules — ideal for learning and experimentation. 🎓💻

📦 Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes:

✈️ Airplane | 🚗 Automobile | 🐦 Bird | 🐱 Cat | 🦌 Deer | 🐕 Dog | 🐸 Frog | 🐎 Horse | 🚢 Ship | 🚚 Truck

✨ Features
🔄 Modular design: clear separation of pipeline steps

📊 Data loading & preprocessing (normalization & label encoding)

🏗 CNN model built with Keras/TensorFlow

⚙️ Training and evaluation script

🎯 Prediction/inference pipeline
