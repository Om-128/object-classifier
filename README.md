CIFAR-10 Object Classification with CNN
A simple, modular Python project for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This implementation focuses on cleanly separating the code for data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, and prediction, intended as a learning resource or baseline.

Dataset
This project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which has 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 categories:

Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck

Features
Modular code: separate modules for each pipeline step

Data loading and preprocessing (normalization, label encoding)

CNN model building with Keras

Training and evaluation scripts

Inference/prediction function

Preprocessing Overview
Images are normalized by dividing pixel values by 255.0.

Labels are converted to one-hot vectors using tf.keras.utils.to_categorical() with the correct number of classes.

Model
The CNN architecture is defined in model.py and can be easily modified for experimentation.

Notes
No web app or GUI in this version; everything runs in simple Python scripts.

This project is meant as a reference and starting point for experimenting with CNNs on image data.
